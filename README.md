Templatized Command Line Argument Parser
========================================

Note: This is a personal fork of TCLAP for making various adjustments
and for making it play nicely with help2man.

TCLAP is a simple C++ library that facilitates parsing command line
arguments in a type independent manner.
It doesn't conform exactly to either the GNU or POSIX standards, although it is close.

See [tclap.sourceforge.net](http://tclap.sourceforge.net) for more information.
